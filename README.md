# What's this?

This right here is the code of a forum dedicated for questions from students.

# How do I use it?

I'm still working on the the full code....
You can see my progress in the [this](https://github.com/FalseDev/student-forum/tree/master/TODOLIST.md) file
Once I'm done with the version 1 , this will be published as a working version at heroku

# Is there any way I can contribute?

You'll have to wait until it's done and then you can spread the word _:)_
For now help me name this....
How would you name a forum for all learners(primarily schooler,I guess)?
